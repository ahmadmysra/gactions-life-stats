# Google Actions example Project

This project was created for [#myweekinjs](http://myweekinjs.com/stats). Please read the article to see how this project came to be and what the final product is.

This project contains a zip file that you can import into [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) to have a look at the configuration. You will also need to setup a [Google Actions](https://developers.google.com/actions/) for this work.

I recommend looking at the Google Actions [documentation](https://developers.google.com/actions/dialogflow/) to get a better overview of the system, especially if you intend to create a similar project yourself.

### Functions
